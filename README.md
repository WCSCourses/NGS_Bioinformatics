Learn to analyse next-generation sequence data to address a wide range of biological questions

# Summary

High-throughput sequencing has gained widespread adoption as an essential experimental assay for biological research. Analysing high-throughput sequencing data involves an array of different bioinformatics tools and techniques. Therefore, it is important for experimental scientists to have the bioinformatics skills required to effectively assess and analyse data produced by next generation sequencing.

This course aims to provide a hands-on introduction to bioinformatics for next generation sequencing and to equip participants with the essential informatics skills and knowledge required to begin analysing next generation sequencing data and carry out some of the most common types of analysis.

# Target Audience

The course is aimed at researchers or clinicians/ healthcare professionals actively engaged in or soon to commence work involving next generation sequencing data analysis.

## Learning outcomes

**What will you be able to do?**

After attending this course, participants will be able to:

- Use the Linux command-line and advanced Linux commands for automating bioinformatics tasks
- Evaluate the results of QC analysis of high throughput sequencing data
- Understand the algorithmic concepts behind short read alignment and variant calling, and have practical experience of using relevant software
- Analyse RNA-Seq data to measure abundance
- Develop bioinformatics workflows

# Programme

The hands-on programme will cover several aspects of next generation sequencing data analysis, including lectures, discussions and practical computational sessions covering the following:

- Introduction to NGS technologies 
- Introduction to the Linux command line
- Linux for bioinformatics
- NGS data formats and tools
- Sequence alignment+QC
- SNP/indel theory and practical
- Structural variation theory and practical
- RNA-seq analysis
- Sequencing data visualisation with the Integrated Genomics Viewer
- Genome assembly
- Bioinformatics workflow essentials
- Participant projects and presentations (final day)

**Please note:** The practical sessions will be taught exclusively through Linux. Therefore, participants are required to have some familiarity with the Linux operating system. This will be essential for participants to fully benefit from the course. With this in mind, we will provide comprehensive pre-course material via our learning management system in the weeks immediately before the course. Additionally, there are numerous online introductory tutorials to the Linux operating system and command line, including:
- [UNIX Tutorial for Beginners](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix)
- [The Unix Shel](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)

The course should not be considered a complete education in the theoretical and mathematical foundations of the topics.
